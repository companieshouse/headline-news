# `notebooks` folder

All Jupyter notebooks should be stored in this folder. The [`.envrc`][docs-envrc] file should automatically add the
entire project path into the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable â€” this should allow you to directly import `src` in your
notebook.

[docs-envrc]: ../docs/structure/README.md#envrc
